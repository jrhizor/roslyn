<h2>Pioneer 3DX</h2>
<p id="pioneer">
The Pioneer 3DX is a robotic base that allows peripherals, such as a an on-board computer or laser range finder, to be attached in order to conduct research.

<h2>Nexus 7 Tablet</h2>
<p id="nexus">
The Nexus 7 tablet acts as a user interface between the user and Roslyn. On the display, the user will be able to begin/end a tour, view a map of the CSE floor, select nearby points of interest from that map, and request information about those points of interest. There will also be a more interactive mode where the tablet will display what the camera sees and allow the user to select points of interest from that perspective.
<hr></p>
<h2>Laptop</h2>
<p id="laptop">
The laptop is used as an onboard computer for Roslyn and executes the launch files that are implemented to allow Roslyn to navigate autonomously when given a destination. The laptop also allows us to communicate with the robot wirelessly if we need to run tests on another computer nearby.
<hr></p>
<h2>Primesense Sensor</h2>
<p id="primesense">
The Primesense sensor is the main input device. We use the information provided by the depth camera to act as laser range scans in order to create a map of the CSE floor as well as allowing Roslyn to localize herself on the map, allowing us to provide relevant points of interest to the user.
