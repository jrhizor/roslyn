The robot is not only able to navigate the halls, but navigate them in a socially acceptable manner. This means it does not collide with pedestrians while in motion and takes walking speed into consideration. In order to interact with the user, there is a touch-screen display mounted on top of the moving robot base. As the robot moves throughout the hall, information appears on the screen related to the landmarks being passed (i.e. laboratories and offices). The user is also able to select a destination on the screen in order to begin the tour.\end{abstract}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}\end{preface}\chapter{First Chapter}The tour guide robot Roslyn is a socially aware autonomous system that can lead tours of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Nevada, Reno. This requires socially acceptable navigation within the second floor of the Scrugham Engineering and Mines building.Tours of the Computer Science and Engineering Department are currently given by faculty and staff, or student ambassadors (typically from other departments). This creates some difficulties for visitors:\begin{itemize} \item A tour can only be scheduled when a faculty or staff member is available. This may conflict with class times, office hours, or other responsibilities \item Giving tours distracts faculty and staff from their normal studies, teaching, research, etc. especially with large groups \item Tours given by student ambassadors are generally limited to superficial knowledge of the department, such as the location of the department office. A typical student ambassador would not be able to answer specific questions about a program, lab, or other facility. \end{itemize}A robotic tour guide could address many of these issues:\begin{itemize} \item A tour with a robot could be scheduled for any time the building is accessible, even after normal working hours. Tours could be scheduled in real-time without concerns about a faculty or staff member’s conflicting schedule. Tours could also be given on demand for visitors on site without an appointment \item A robot could be dedicated entirely to giving tours, and would not become distracted by other activities \item A robot could be provided up-to-date information by a departmental authority, or lookup information in real time.\end{itemize}Some challenges are present for a robotic tour guide in a situated academic environment, all of which shall be addressed in this thesis:\begin{itemize} \item Safe navigation: both globally and locally. A global plan must be generated for every destination which will optimize the route taken to the destination. A local plan must also be generated which avoids obstacles such as walls, items in a hallway, and moving people. This local plan must also lead the user on a reasonable path and a reasonable pace. \item Self safety: the robot must not endanger itself. Some potential safety concerns include stairwells and objects mounted outside of the robot’s view (ie drinking fountains, which are mounted above a laser range finder’s plane of view). \item Power and portability constraints: the wireless network installed in the Scrugham Engineering and Mines building is insufficient for real-time sensor data transmission, thus all processing must be performed on the robot. Thus there are constraints on the amount of power the robot can deliver to its computational components, the battery life of the robot and these components, and the maximum reasonable size of these components.\end{itemize}In order for the robot to be socially aware, it must not only lead its user at a comfortable distance and pace, but also keep other humans and obstacles at a safe distance. A human tour guide would not walk exceptionally fast away from their group or walk uncomfortably close to them, thus the robot should not either.The tour guide robot is primarily composed of three distinct nodes, which are each discussed independently due to their complexity. The first node, labeled ROS Nodes in Fig. 1, is a collection of pre-existing open source ROS nodes which provide data and processing facilities to the system. These nodes are not being developed by the team, but are distributed by the Open Source Robotics Foundation.The second node, labeled User Interface in Fig. 1, provides a user-friendly interaction between the robot and user(s). This allows the users to select a destination, as well as request and view more information about their surroundings via a touchscreen tablet on the robot.The third node, labeled Social Navigation in Fig. 1, safely navigates the robot through the dynamic environment and ensures proper social interactions with the user.Roslyn is composed of two independent programs:\begin{itemize} \item Roslyn is able to map an environment and use the map for future navigation. This is done the first time Roslyn is introduced to a particular building and does not have to be repeated. \item Roslyn uses the building map in its second program along with its sensors and communication pathways to communicate with the user interface and drive itself.\end{itemize}Roslyn is composed of a number of hardware components:\begin{itemize} \item The robotic base: a Pioneer 3DX \item An internal computer: a Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 2 \item A laser rangefinder: a SICK LMS 100 or a Hokoyu URG-04LX-UG01 \item A laptop: Intel® Core™ i5-2450M @ 2.50GHz with 8 GB of RAM or better \item The user interface: a Nexus 7 2013 \item A custom stand for the Nexus 7 2013\end{itemize}The rest of this thesis is organized as follows:...\section{Need Finding}A survey was distributed to the engineers developing this project, several current students, and two prospective CS students currently in high school. A total of ten individuals responded. The interview questions are included in Appendix \#\#\#.\subsection{Interview Findings}Almost all of the interviewees claimed to prefer voice or touch screen interfaces to the tour guide robot. Half of the individuals believed that a robot tour guide had the potential to be as good as a human tour guide. The choice between an established path and a custom path selected by the users was highly controversial. This result suggests that users may want the option to select either option. The one unanimous answer was that the robot should move at a normal walking pace. Unfortunately, our robot cannot travel at full walking speed. Surprisingly, almost all individuals want the robot to stop at interest points and wait for the user’s input to continue. None selected to continue automatically, and only a couple wanted the robot to slow near the interest point. The desired humanness of the robot varied greatly across responses. For human questions, the results were split; some wanted a FAQ, some wanted to have the question forwarded to a human, and some wanted both. Additionally, there was an even split between who would select a human tour guide versus a robot tour guide given the option. Regardless of the type of tour guide, interviewees wanted a primarily friendly and informative tour guide. When asked to evaluate positive experiences with tour guides, most referred to tour guides telling personal stories, being funny, or simply friendly. On the other hand, poor tours consisted of bored guides who were uninformative, rushed, boring, and not funny. The final question asks for feature requests. No trends existed in the responses, but several sought to address the limitations of a robot; one person wanted the robot to have a human remotely answer questions.\section{Requirements Specification and Use Cases}This section describes the design of Roslyn’s internal systems.\subsection{Functional Requirements}Table \ref{table:functional-requirements} describes the functional requirements of Roslyn.

It displays the begin tour button, as well as the map and interactive mode buttons for different views.When the “map” view is selected, Figure \ref{fig:ui2} is the screen that appears. If there are no set markers on the map, this is exactly what the user will see. It is important to note that this map view has the same menu overlay as shown on the welcome screen above that contains the title bar and buttons.In addition to the map in figure \ref{fig:ui2}, figure \ref{fig:ui3} shows the marker which represents a point of interest along the tour which can be selected by touching the marker. Touching the marker creates a popup with information about that location.In addition to the map in figure \ref{fig:ui3}, figure \ref{fig:ui4} shows the popup (shown above the blue marker) which appears above the location providing details about the point of interest.The “map” view contains a zoom capability, shown in figure \ref{fig:ui5}. The user is able to zoom in and out to a predefined maximum and minimum zoom levels. This image shows what the interface looks like when zoomed in all the way.When the “interactive” view is selected, the screen shown in figure \ref{fig:ui6} appears. If there are no points of interest in the vicinity, then no markers appear.If there are points of interest in the vicinity of the robot, then markers will appear on the interaction screen shown in figure \ref{fig:ui7} representing the location of the points of interest.When the user chooses to end a tour, the farewell message shown in figure \ref{fig:ui8} appears, thanking the user for his/her time.\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui1.png} \caption{User Interface - Welcome} \label{fig:ui1}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui2.png} \caption{User Interface - Map} \label{fig:ui2}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui3.png} \caption{User Interface - Map with marker} \label{fig:ui3}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui4.png} \caption{User Interface - Map with marker, description} \label{fig:ui4}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui5.png} \caption{User Interface - Map zoomed} \label{fig:ui5}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui6.png} \caption{User Interface - Interactive} \label{fig:ui6}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui7.png} \caption{User Interface - Interactive Markers} \label{fig:ui7}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ui8.png} \caption{User Interface - Goodbye} \label{fig:ui8}\end{figure}\section{Glossary}\begin{longtable}{p{3cm}p{9.9cm}}\caption[Glossary of Terms]{Glossary of Terms} \label{table:glossart} \\\hline \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Term}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Definition}} \\ \hline \endfirsthead\multicolumn{2}{c}%{{\bfseries \tablename\ \thetable{} -- continued from previous page}} \\\hline \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Term}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Definition}} \\ \hline \endhead\multicolumn{2}{r}{{Continued on next page}} \\ \hline\endfoot\endlastfootAMCL&A ROS package that uses Monte Carlo localization and particle filtering to determine the location and orientation of the robot. \\Autonomous&A type of system that operates without continual guidance of an external operator.\\Costmap&A representation of the robot’s possible paths using weighted mathematical functions to represent the cost of points in certain paths.
